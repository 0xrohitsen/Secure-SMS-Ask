## 📖 About The Project

**Secure SMS Ask** is an open-source Android SMS forwarder app built with a privacy-first philosophy. It gives you full control over your SMS messages by allowing you to forward them to another mobile number or a secure Telegram Bot. Your data remains on your device, ensuring your conversations are always private, secure, and delivered instantly.

Built for personal use, Secure SMS Ask is ad-free, tracker-free, and does not rely on any third-party analytics or cloud services. It's the simple, powerful SMS forwarding app you've been looking for.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Unyielding Privacy**: No data collection, no tracking, no ads. Your privacy is the top priority.
- **↪️ Dual Forwarding**: Forward SMS to another mobile number, a secure Telegram bot, or both. Control each destination independently.
- **📱 Dual SIM Support**: Explicitly choose which SIM to use for sending forwarded messages.
- **⚡ Instant Delivery**: Forwards all incoming SMS—including OTPs, banking alerts, and personal texts—within 1-2 seconds.
- **🔁 Intelligent Loop Prevention**: Critical safety logic prevents infinite forwarding loops and duplicate messages.
- **⚙️ Robust Background Service**: Runs as a persistent foreground service that auto-restarts on boot, ensuring the app is never killed by the OS.
- **🔒 On-Device & Offline First**: All processing happens locally. Internet is only used if you enable Telegram forwarding.
- **🎨 Beautiful Material You UI**: A clean, modern interface with light & dark modes, smooth animations, and clear visual feedback.
- **🌍 Open Source**: The complete, well-commented source code is available on GitHub for full transparency.
